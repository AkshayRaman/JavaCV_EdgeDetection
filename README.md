JavaCV_EdgeDetection
====================

Implements the following edge detection algorithms:<br>
  Canny Edge Detection<br>
  Laplacian Edge Detection<br>
  Sobel Edge Detection<br>

Instructions to build the code:
<br>NOTE: For a 32-bit system, make sure you use 32-bit Java and 32-bit OpenCV and 32-bit JavaCV ONLY.

1. Download OpenCV from https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-win/3.1.0/opencv-3.1.0.exe/download
This has been built and tested on OpenCV 3.1.0

2. Extract the contents of the file. For more details, go to http://docs.opencv.org/master/d3/d52/tutorial_windows_install.html

3. Download the JavaCV jar files. Refer: https://github.com/bytedeco/javacv#downloads

4. Add the JavaCV jar files to the build path on your IDE (I used eclipse)
