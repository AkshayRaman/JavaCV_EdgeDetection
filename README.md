JavaCV_EdgeDetection
====================

Implements some basic edge detection algorithms

Instructions to build the code:
For a 32-bit system, make sure you use 32-bit Java and 32-bit OpenCV and 32-bit JavaCV ONLY.(https://code.google.com/p/javacv/source/browse/README.txt#24)

1. Download OpenCV from http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-win/2.4.5/OpenCV-2.4.5.exe/download
I used version 2.4.5 to create the application, but there are later versions availabile.

2. Extract the contents of the file. For more details, go to http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/introduction/windows_install/windows_install.html#windows-installation

3. Download the JavaCV jar files. Refer: http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~cs10/install/javacv-win/

4. Add the JavaCV jar files to the build path on your IDE (I used eclipse)
